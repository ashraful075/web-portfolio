        <h3>World-Class Batsman</h3>
        <p>How Bangladesh cricket will view Mohammad Ashraful remains up for debate. For several years this boy wonder raised the country's cricket to a surfer's optimism from the debilitating quicksand that was their initiation into Test cricket since 2000, only to let the country and the sport down when he admitted to his involvement in match-fixing and spot-fixing in the Bangladesh Premier League.

            <p>He remains one of the most frustrating cricketers. He makes Bangladesh fans tear their hair out because his achievements do no justice to his immense talent. He had been their first truly world class player and the fact that he was so young when he first shot to fame made it even more difficult for the public to digest. They felt that he was their answer to Sachin Tendulkar. Such early praise did him no good though.</p>

            <p>
                After his 2007 World Cup performance, the media wanted to see their golden boy take to captaincy, but it didn't work out well. He immediately fell further as a batsman in his two-year stint that also saw the loss of players to the Indian Cricket League in 2008. There were allegations of him being willing to play in the rebel league. He lost his captaincy to Mashrafe Mortaza after his affinity for a dab past the wicketkeeper cost Bangladesh a game against Ireland in the 2009 World Twenty20. And as the team started to have more performers, he lost his place regularly in the next few years. However, in March 2013, he made 190 against Sri Lanka in the Galle Test, an evolved innings which earned fulsome praise.

            <p>As a batsman, the trouble with Ashraful has been his inconsistency. As long as you enjoy the highlight reel of his career, everything seems rosy: whether it was in becoming the youngest Test centurion in 2001, the unbeaten 158 against India in 2004, the magnificent 100 he made against Australia in Cardiff in 2005 triggering a huge upset, or the innovative 87 against South Africa in the 2007 World Cup, Ashraful provided the entertainment quotient that turned heads towards Bangladesh. When he made a comeback in 2013 after being dropped due to poor form, he made 190 against Sri Lanka.
